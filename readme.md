# Build a Video Game Aggregator
Over the years I've spent a lot of time at [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) watching various tutorials, but as I personally spend most of my time working with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) I decided I'd like to recreate a few of their projects in **_my_** framework of choice, and thought I'd release them to the public to allow anyone (that's interested) to see a direct comparison of the 2 frameworks and their methodologies.

This repo does not contain any of the course material, and there is no tutorial as such to accompany so an element of familiarity with both frameworks is required.

All credit for the course, and it's content belongs to Laracasts and the course tutor Andre Madarang.
